### What is Fluorite?
Fluorite is a note taking application that is design customer validation process.

### How are you different to other note taking application?
Other application are more general purpose note taking application. Sure they can do the job, but there you need to configure and there is some drawback that you have to live with.

With Fluorite, you get a note taking application that is design with customer validation in mind. Some key difference are:
- Launching the Fluorite goes directly to creating the note screen. This is very useful because you can never know when you will be speaking to your customer. It can be during lunch or even riding the elevator. The ability to create a note with a single click is important for you to write as fast as you can so you don't miss out on any details.
- Attach emotion with the note. Customer emotion during the interview is important. You want to know how does he feel when he is describing the problem. Is he happy or sad? With Fluorite you can show this emotion in the note itself.

These are some of the key difference between Fluorite and other note taking application.
